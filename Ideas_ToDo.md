# Ideas
- Spawnable apparatus
- Spawnable Beehive
- Spawnable Mines and Turrets
- Youtube Boombox (maybe as a different mod, because the YT Boombox mod on Thunderstore doesnt always work)

# ToDo
- Fix @"me" argument because playerreference sometimes breaks
- Fix @"playername" for some reason breaking
- Improve Networking (maybe with something else than Chat Communications)
- Fix togglelights
