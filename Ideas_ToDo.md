# Ideas
- ~~Spawnable apparatus~~ Implemented in 2.0.0
- ~~Spawnable Beehive~~ Implemented in 2.0.0
- ~~Make everything spawnable anywhere (maybe not possible)~~ Implemented in 2.0.0
- ~~Spawnable Mines and Turrets~~ Implemented in 1.1.6
- Youtube Boombox (maybe as a separate mod, because the YT Boombox mod on Thunderstore doesnt always work)
