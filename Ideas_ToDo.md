# Ideas
- Spawnable apparatus
- Spawnable Beehive
- ~~Spawnable Mines and Turrets~~ Implemented in 1.1.6
- Youtube Boombox (maybe as a different mod, because the YT Boombox mod on Thunderstore doesnt always work)

# ToDo
- ~~Fix @"me" argument because playerreference sometimes breaks~~ Should be fixed in 1.1.6
- Fix @"playername" for some reason breaking
- Improve Networking (maybe with something else than Chat Communications)
- Fix togglelights
- Fix weather
- Fix gun spawning
